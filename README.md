### Abstract:
An approach, based on a multi-plane system, is conceptualized in this work to solve the problem of collision avoidance for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles, being used for search and rescue to minimize affecting the searching algorithm. Relevant chronological advancements in the last two decades of the parent algorithm, particle swarm optimization, are summarized. As each optimization algorithm for search and rescue has its own niche area of application, various well-established algorithms such as particle swarm optimization and novel algorithms like layered search and rescue, spiral search and fish-inspired task allocation are compared with each other qualitatively. Simulations with 100 different cases were used to compare the original particle swarm optimization with the additional novel collision avoidance algorithm. The statistical z test was run based on which it was found that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of collisions and does not put a toll on the iterations to convergence. Standardized residuals of all cases indicate minimal error difference in the optimum average fitness value calculated by the particle swarm optimization, with and without the conceptualized anti-collision algorithm.

### Conlusion:
A novel collision avoidance algorithm is proposed for the application of a swarm of UAVs
operating on particle swarm optimization for search and rescue operations. The collision
avoidance algorithm is simulated for a total of 100 cases with 200 data points which were
generated by varying swarm size, iterations, height between the planes, threshold Euclidean
distance for collisions and objective functions. As the p value of the statistical z test is 8.46 x
10-75, results of the statistical z test run on the simulation data set favour the alternate
hypothesis that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the total number of collisions.
The reason behind this result is that each UAV is allowed to move in its own independent
space using a multiplane approach without altering the parent algorithm. Moreover, the
results of the simulations indicate that the new algorithm does not affect the efficacy of
original algorithm as the average of iterations to convergence and the trend of standardized
residuals is same for both, original PSO and proposed algorithm.
